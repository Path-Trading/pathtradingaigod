## 📚 Overview

The platform integrates advanced AI models for:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding market sentiment from real-time social data.
- **Signal Processing**: Detecting trends and market opportunities.
- **Trading Automation**: Executing strategies with 24/7 autonomous agents.

This repository is a blueprint for a decentralized, data-driven trading platform built to handle the chaotic dynamics of meme-driven and speculative markets.
